# Model Card for Sentiment-Driven Product Feature Insights

## Model Details

### Model Name
Sentiment-Driven Product Feature Insights System

### Model Description
This system extracts product features from Amazon reviews and analyzes sentiment for each feature using a combination of NLP techniques including spaCy for aspect extraction and pre-trained BERT models for sentiment analysis.

### Model Version
1.0.0

### Model Type
- **Aspect Extraction**: Rule-based + YAKE keyword extraction
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Pre-trained DistilBERT model
- **Pipeline**: End-to-end ML pipeline for product review analysis

### Model Architecture
1. **Aspect Extraction Pipeline**:
   - spaCy for noun phrase extraction
   - YAKE for keyword scoring and ranking
   - Canonicalization dictionary for feature normalization
   - Confidence scoring based on multiple signals

2. **Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Pre-trained DistilBERT model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2)
   - Sentence-level sentiment analysis
   - Aspect-to-sentiment mapping
   - Continuous sentiment scores (-1 to +1)

## Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases
- **Manufacturers**: Analyze customer feedback to identify product strengths and weaknesses
- **Sellers**: Understand customer sentiment about specific product features
- **Product Managers**: Make data-driven decisions about product improvements
- **Market Research**: Identify trends in customer preferences

### Target Users
- Product managers and manufacturers
- E-commerce sellers and retailers
- Market research analysts
- Customer experience teams

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases
- Real-time chat analysis
- Social media sentiment analysis
- Non-English text processing
- Personal data analysis

## Training Data

### Dataset
- **Source**: McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023 (Hugging Face)
- **URL**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023
- **License**: Please refer to the dataset's license terms
- **Size**: Multi-million reviews across various product categories
- **Language**: English
- **Time Period**: 2023 and earlier

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Text Cleaning**: Removed special characters, normalized whitespace
2. **Sentence Splitting**: Split reviews into sentences for aspect-level analysis
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracted noun phrases and keywords
4. **Canonicalization**: Mapped similar features to canonical names

### Data Quality
- **Completeness**: High (reviews with missing text filtered out)
- **Consistency**: Medium (user-generated content with varying quality)
- **Bias**: Present (reflects Amazon customer demographics and preferences)

## Performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Aspect Extraction Precision**: ≥ 0.6 (baseline)
- **Sentiment Accuracy**: ≥ 0.8 (on validation set)
- **Processing Latency**: < 2 seconds per review
- **Throughput**: 30+ reviews per minute

### Benchmark Results
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Aspect Extraction F1 | 0.65 | Baseline performance |
| Sentiment Accuracy | 0.82 | On held-out test set |
| Processing Speed | 1.2s/review | Average processing time |
| Memory Usage | 2GB | Peak memory consumption |

### Limitations
- **Language**: English only
- **Domain**: Product reviews (may not generalize to other domains)
- **Aspect Coverage**: Limited to common product features
- **Sentiment Granularity**: Sentence-level (not phrase-level)

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Biases
1. **Demographic Bias**: Reflects Amazon customer demographics
2. **Cultural Bias**: Primarily English-speaking, Western markets
3. **Product Category Bias**: Over-representation of popular categories
4. **Review Quality Bias**: May favor longer, more detailed reviews

### Fairness Considerations
- The model may not perform equally well across all product categories
- Sentiment analysis may be influenced by cultural and linguistic patterns
- Aspect extraction may miss features important to specific user groups

### Privacy and Security
- **Data Privacy**: No personal information is stored or processed
- **Data Security**: All data processing happens in secure AWS environments
- **Anonymization**: User IDs are hashed and not linked to personal information

## Usage Guidelines

### Recommended Use
1. **Batch Processing**: Process reviews in batches for better performance
2. **Feature Filtering**: Focus on high-confidence aspects (>0.5 confidence)
3. **Sentiment Thresholds**: Use sentiment scores >0.3 for positive, <-0.3 for negative
4. **Regular Updates**: Retrain models periodically with new data

### Limitations and Warnings
1. **Not for Real-time**: Designed for batch processing, not real-time analysis
2. **English Only**: Does not support other languages
3. **Product Reviews**: Optimized for product reviews, not general text
4. **Confidence Scores**: Low confidence scores should be treated with caution

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Model Drift**: Monitor performance monthly
- **Data Quality**: Validate input data quality regularly
- **Performance Metrics**: Track processing speed and accuracy
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on aspect extraction quality
