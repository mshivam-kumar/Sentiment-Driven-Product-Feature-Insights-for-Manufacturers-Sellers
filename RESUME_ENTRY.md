# Resume Entry: Enhanced RAG System with Transformer Models

## AI-Powered Product Analytics Platform with Advanced RAG Architecture | Link [Dec 2024 - Present]

### Technical Achievements:

**ðŸ”§ Advanced RAG System Implementation:**
- Architected a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combining semantic search with transformer-based text generation
- Integrated **TinyLlama (1.1B parameters)** for natural language response generation, achieving 60% more coherent responses compared to rule-based systems
- Implemented **sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2** for semantic similarity search with 0.89 cosine similarity accuracy on product reviews

**ðŸ¤– Transformer Model Integration:**
- Deployed pre-trained transformer models for context-aware text generation using Hugging Face Transformers library
- Achieved **4.5x faster inference** by using TinyLlama over larger models while maintaining superior response quality
- Implemented fallback mechanisms ensuring 99.8% system reliability with graceful degradation to rule-based generation

**ðŸ“Š Production-Scale Data Processing:**
- Processed **500+ product reviews** with real-time sentiment analysis and feature extraction
- Built AWS-integrated pipeline with DynamoDB for storing sentiment insights and API Gateway for RESTful access
- Achieved **sub-2 second response times** for complex queries across multiple product categories

**ðŸš€ Full-Stack Deployment:**
- Containerized application using Docker with optimized multi-stage builds reducing image size by 35%
